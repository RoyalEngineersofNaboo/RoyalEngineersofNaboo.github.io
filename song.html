<hr><p></p>
<p>O God, you know my rest and waking,</p>
<p>When I lie down and when I rise anew.</p>
<p>You search my thought, my inmost inclination,</p>
<p>The words I speak, the ways I walk,</p>
<p>you know them too.</p>
<p>You saw when I was made in secret,</p>
<p>My very bones not hidden from your sight.</p>
<p>You saw my form; its parts were down in writing.</p>
<p>I praise the wonder of your ways,</p>
<p>extol your might.</p>
<p>Your knowledge, God, is wondrous, fear-inspiring;</p>
<p>Of this my soul is very well aware.</p>
<p>If I should fear that darkness might enfold me,</p>
<p>Your spirit, God, would find me, even there.</p>
<p>Where could I hide from you, Jehovah,</p>
<p>Or be concealed, be hidden from your face?</p>
<p>Not in the heights nor in the depth of Sheol,</p>
<p>Not in the dark nor in the sea, there is no place.</p>
