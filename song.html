<hr>
<p>Ev’ry newborn child, Ev’ry drop of rain,</p>
<p>Ev’ry golden ray of sun, Each head of grain—</p>
<p>All are gifts from God; They reveal his way.</p>
<p>Miracles performed by him sustain us each day.</p>
<p>So, what are we to do with a gift so rare</p>
<p>But to love the One who gave it and show him we care.</p>
<p>No matter what we do, We never can earn it.</p>
<p>This gift is still a gift—The miracle of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Others may give up, Lose their will to try,</p>
<p>Echoing the wife of Job: “Curse God and die.”</p>
<p>We are not that way. Praise to God we give,</p>
<p>Thanking him for ev’ry precious moment we live.</p>
<p>So, what are we to do with a gift so rare</p>
<p>But to love the ones around us and show them we care.</p>
<p>No matter what we do, We never can earn it.</p>
<p>This gift is still a gift—The miracle of life.</p>
